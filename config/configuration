# This is the OpenDaVINCI configuration for OpenDLV.
# Its format is like:
#
# section.key=value
#
# If you have several modules of the same type, the following configuration
# scheme applies:
#
# global.key=value # <-- This configuration applies for all modules.
#
# section.key=value # <-- This configuration applies for all modules of type "section".
#
# section:ID.key=value # <-- This configuration applies for the module "ID" of type "section".

# GLOBAL CONFIGURATION
#

# The following attributes define the buffer sizes for recording and
# replaying. You need to adjust these parameters depending on the
# camera resolution for example (640x480x3 --> 1000000 for memorySegment,
# 1280x720x3 --> 2800000).
global.buffer.memorySegmentSize = 2800000 # Size of a memory segment in bytes.
global.buffer.numberOfMemorySegments = 20 # Number of memory segments.


#
# CONFIGURATION FOR ODSUPERCOMPONENT
#

# If the managed level is pulse_shift, all connected modules will be informed
# about the supercomponent's real time by this increment per module. Thus, the
# execution times per modules are better aligned with supercomponent and the
# data exchange is somewhat more predictable.
odsupercomponent.pulseshift.shift = 10000 # (in microseconds)

# If the managed level is pulse_time_ack, this is the timeout for waiting for
# an ACK message from a connected client.
odsupercomponent.pulsetimeack.timeout = 5000 # (in milliseconds)

# If the managed level is pulse_time_ack, the modules are triggered sequentially
# by sending pulses and waiting for acknowledgment messages. To allow the modules
# to deliver their respective containers, this yielding time is used to sleep
# before supercomponent sends the pulse messages the next module in this execution
# cycle. This value needs to be adjusted for networked simulations to ensure
# deterministic execution. 
odsupercomponent.pulsetimeack.yield = 5000 # (in microseconds)


#
# CONFIGURATION FOR PROXY
#
proxy.debug = 0
proxy.useRecorder = 0 # 1 = record all captured data directly, 0 otherwise. 
proxy.recorder.output = file://recs/
proxy.camera.name = WebCam
proxy.camera.type = NULL # OpenCV or UEYE
proxy.camera.id = 0 # Select here the proper ID for OpenCV
proxy.camera.width = 752 #752-UEYE, 640-OpenCV 
proxy.camera.height = 480
proxy.camera.bpp = 1 #3- openCV, 1-UEYE
